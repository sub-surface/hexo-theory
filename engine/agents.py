    origin. Port of Hamkins-Leonessi §3 mirroring idea (Infinite Hex is a draw,
    2022) adapted to HeXO's Z[omega] lattice.

    Strategy. Maintain a queue of opponent stones whose reflection we still
    owe. On each call to choose_move, pop the oldest and play -c. If the
    reflection is occupied, fall back to a nearest-empty-neighbour response,
    then to an immediate-win / immediate-block, then a random legal cell.

    Limitations.
    - Not a proven winning / drawing strategy for HeXO: a Connect-6 line
      through c does NOT in general pass through -c (except along axes through
      the origin), so this is a weaker-than-Hamkins pairing. The empirical
      target is Proposition P2 in docs/theory/2026-04-17-hamkins-synthesis.md:
      non-loss >= 90% vs Random, and strictly < 50% as second player vs any
      stronger agent (consistent with strategy-stealing).
    - Does not know its own history. We reconstruct the "owed" queue on each
      call from game.move_history + player_history, so the agent is stateless
      between calls and safe to use across multiprocessing workers.
