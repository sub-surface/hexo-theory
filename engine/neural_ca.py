"""
Neural cellular-automaton policy agent for HeXO, on torch + CUDA.

Design.
  - Board state is a (3, H, W) tensor of one-hot channels [empty, P1, P2],
    windowed around the current stone cloud with a pad margin so the NCA
    receptive field sees the full WIN_LENGTH=6 neighbourhood.
  - The "cellular automaton" is a stack of hex-convolution layers: 3x3 axial
    conv with the two unused corners zeroed, producing a true 6-neighbour
    hex kernel. Depth D gives receptive-field radius D hops — we default
    D=6 to match WIN_LENGTH.
  - Output: a single (1, H, W) score map; masked by legality and by the
    adjacency frontier, then argmax'd to choose the move.
  - Parameters are random by default (no training yet). The point of the
    untrained version is to (a) prove the GPU pipeline is live, (b) give
    us a baseline random-NN agent to measure against once training lands,
    and (c) provide a substrate for neural-CA-style evolution experiments.

This is the torch+CUDA implementation required by the
``feedback_neural_ca_torch`` user preference (2026-04-17).
